# HCI Final By: Zackary Fitzgibbon
    

## Design Process 
Through out this whole class we have learned many different aspects of good design and different tools to use to create comprehensible designs. The first design tool we learned was CRAP, or Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity. Using just this acronym and no other tools you can create very good looking designs but in order for them to be comprehensible you need other knowledge. One thing we learned that helps make information more comprehensible is the use of color. Color is a very useful tool but can be harmful if used wrong. The brain has a hard time recognizing where on a color spectrum a specific color is if it is a gradient but not when each item has its own seperate color. The oposite is true with size. The brain has a hard time recognizing seperate items when each one has its own size but it can easily pick out where on a gradient it falls. If you are using a gradient, you should use size and area, but if you are using a seprate identifier for each item, use color. Over the course of all the different projects we did multiple differnt prototyping including paper and a rough version of the product. Paper prototyping if very useful but only for a select kind of projects. If there is too much interactivity a paper prototype is very hard to produce and very hard to convey what the actual product will look like. If your product does not have too much interactivity then paper protypes are the way to go as they dont take much time to create. Also if you do have to completely recreate the design then you dont feel as bad as you would if you had spent hours on the protype. Rough versions are very useful if there is a lot of interactivity that you could not convey through paper. They are also good if you know what you want the final product to look like and there are just a few things about it that you want to test. With paper you would most likely have to recreate the whole thing just to change small things, but with code you can copy and paste to have multiple prototypes with slight changes to them. Over this course I have created a 5 step procces for my design process. 
## -Step 1
Define the problem. 

## -Step 2
Brainstorm ideas without thinking about how to create them.

## -Step 3
Look at the tools you have to create the design and narrow down the ideas from step 2.

## -Step 4
Create a prototype or multiple prototypes based on how many designs are left.

## -Step 5
Gather feedback from the protypes and create the finished product.

# Projects:    
Here are some of the projects that I made during this class using the above mentioned design tools and while developing my 5 step method.
